<FONT size=3>After waiting to hear from you or your Nigeria partners for a long time now. I decided to make this direct approach to you in other not to let it be as if I have anything in mind against you. I do not know if you have asked yourself why each time the release of this fund is approved, all of sudden, the payment will be stopped or one problem or the other will come up. If you have not asked this question or you do not know, this is an opportunity for me to tell you.</FONT></DIV>

<DIV>
<FONT size=3>Sometime ago, your Nigerian friend I mean the people that introduced you to the project approached me through my dear friend who works with the Federal Ministry of Finance and asked me to assist them conclude a money transfer deal they had with you, they requested me to assist them by removing the original contractor?? name, company?? name and your bank particulars from Central Bank of Nigeria (C.B.N) Vetting and replacing them with your name and your bank details in order to make you appear as the rightful beneficiary of this funds. I agreed on conditions that they would pay me US$1,500,000.00M as soon as your name appears as the beneficiary. I did as agreed and demanded to be paid but your friends started giving me excuses. They even told me that you promised to send money to me, do you know that up till now, I have not received a single cent from them and have not set my eyes on any of them. Based on their attitude, I decided to stop the funds release movement because I cann</FONT></DIV>

<DIV>
<FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3>Secondly, I know the source of the funds that you did not execute any contract in Nigeria , although I am the only person privileged to know this information and it is a fact. Why I am making this clear to you is that I can see that you are still making frantic efforts to conclude this project. Now I am ready to forget the past. I do not need the US$1,500,000.00M any longer from you but a good compensation from your mind. I need your assurance that your colleagues will be totally kept out of this transaction.</FONT></DIV>

<FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3>I know quite well that none of them is aware of my new approach to you Stop spending your money unnecessarily to CBN Officers and other related agencies both here and overseas because you will not receive this money without my hand in it. I personally perfected the change of the documents at the very beginning and only I can perform it. The secret is that your partners failed to stamp duty your contract documents.</FONT></DIV>

<DIV>
<FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3>Finally, I need your promise that no official of the Central Bank of Nigeria or any form of person you might presently been dealing with in Nigeria will be aware of my involvement in this regard because of my position. Now re-assure me that you will be willing to compensate me. That you will assist my first son (DAYO) to establish a foreign account in your country where my compensation will be deposited. I am a woman of my words, if you are ready to conclude this business with me, kindly get back to me so that I could give you more information over this issue once and for all. But if the reverse is the case, do not bother yourself to reach me and forget about this money.</FONT></DIV>
